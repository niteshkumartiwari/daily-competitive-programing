/*
Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:

Only one letter can be changed at a time.
Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is not a transformed word.

Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output: 5

Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",return its length 5

I agree with sqrt(N)/2. Say the ladder is of length 'len', and each word branches out 'm' new words.
From one end, we have to generate O(m^len) branches. Yet from both ends, we are only supposed to generate O(2m^(len/2)) braches.
 So we are sqrt(m^len)/2 times faster.
